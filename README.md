Analysis of Amazon Vine Program

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Vine program, specifically in regards to unpaid and paid program reviews.

Results:

- Question 1: Are unpaid reviews more favorable than paid reviews?
  - Results: Unpaid reviews have a higher percentage of 5-star ratings (45.47%) compared to paid reviews (40.39%).
- Question 2: Is there a difference in the total number of 5 star reviews given by unpaid and paid reviewers?
  - Results: Unpaid reviewers gave a total of 10310 5-star reviews, while paid reviewers gave a total of 103 5-star reviews.
- Question 3: What is the total number of paid and unpaid reviews a factor?
  - Results: The total number of paid reviews is 255, and the total number of unpaid reviews is 22675. This gives weight to the unpapid reviews by a considerable amount. Vine reviews account for only ~1% of the total reviews.

Summary:

Based on the results, it appears that there is bias present in the Vine program towards unpaid reviews. The results show that unpaid reviews have a higher percentage of 5-star ratings and a higher total number of 5-star reviews compared to paid reviews. Additionally, there is a difference in the total number of paid and unpaid reviews. To further support this statement, an additional analysis should be conducted to examine the specific factors that contribute to this bias. This can include looking at the demographics of unpaid vs paid reviewers, the length and content of their reviews, or the timing of their reviews. This outcome could be due to the narrowing of the data. Parameters chosen to find the most helpful reviews could also be tweaked for a different analysis.
